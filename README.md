Caesar Cipher: This took me forever! I looked through the Ruby API for a bit and came across .each_char and a few other options that I tried out.
I felt I was really close with my code as I wasn't getting any name or method undefined errors, but I reached my wits end and looked at some example codes...
Only to discover I was supposed to be using modulo in the expression that shifted the character being used in the array.
I threw that in there and viola...I forgot to account for uppercase letters lmao. I'll come back to this one.
